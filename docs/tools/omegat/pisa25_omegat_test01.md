# PISA 2025 OmegaT testing

## Test 1: download a new OmegaT project (translation)

(Remember to put yourself in the shoes of a generic user, which could be a translator from a PISA participant, a verifier, etc.)

The test should take 5-10 min. Please follow the steps:

*Steps:*

1. Create a new (hence, empty) folder in your machine. Call that folder `PISA_2025_fr-ZZ_Translation1_OMT`.   
*Below you can see some tips for file organization (that's not part of the test, but feel free to follow them and provide feedback if you like).*
2. Right-click [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/capstanlqc-pisa/pisa_t1-t2-rec_3omt_repo/master/t01_omt/omegat.project) and then select **Save Link As** from the contextual menu (or **Save Target As**, depending on the browser) to download the OmegaT project file. 
3. Put this `omegat.project` file inside the folder you created in the previous step. That folder is now your OmegaT project.
4. Run OmegaT (version 5.7.1 of course) and open the OmegaT project. 
<!-- 4. Go ahead and translate (part of) the project (not part of the test either). You're working in a team, leave a bit for the others ;) -->

### File organization

File organization on your end is very important for the successful execution of your work. Here come some recommendations for a tidy organization.

1. Designate a working folder for the project in your machine (the project being PISA25 in this case), and use that same location for all related tasks. We would suggest a location at a very high level in the folder structure in your machine, e.g. one of the following
  + On Windows: `C:\Work\CLIENT\PROJECT` or `C:\Users\USER\Work\CLIENT\PROJECT`
  + On Mac/Linux: `/Users/USER/Work/CLIENT/PROJECT`

2. Inside the PROJECT's working folder above, create the following folder structure (or something similar that fits your purposes):

```
    ├── 00_Admin
    ├── 01_Instructions
    ├── 02_Tasks
    └── 03_Whatever
``` 

Create your OmegaT project folders inside, say, `C:\Users\Manolo\Work\cApStAn\TestingProj\02_Tasks`. The final path to the OmegaT project folder should look like `C:\Users\USER\Work\CLIENT\PROJECT\02_Tasks\OMT-PROJ-DIR`, where `OMT-PROJ-DIR` is (the name of) your local OmegaT project folder.
