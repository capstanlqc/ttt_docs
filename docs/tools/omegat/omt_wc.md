# How to run a wordcount analysis in OmegaT

The following steps show how to obtain a wordcount analysis report from OmegaT without opening OmegaT.

## Steps 

1. Connect to `Ur` and go to the `/media/data/data/company/cApStAn_Tech/11_WC` folder (probably `U:\cApStAn_Tech\11_WC` on Windows).

  You will see three main folders: 

  ``` 
  ├── 01_ToAnalyze
  ├── 02_Projects
  ├── 03_Analyzed
  └── _tech
  ``` 

2. Drop your files in the `01_ToAnalyze` folder.

  > Caveat: your file should only contain the translatable text. You're reponsible for removing any text you don't want to analyze.

3. After 1 minute, retrieve your wordcount analysis report in `03_Analyzed`.
