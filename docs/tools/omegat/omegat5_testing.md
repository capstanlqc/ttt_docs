## Introduction 

OmegaT 5 is the current latest version, where a few bugs found while using OmegaT 4 have been fixed (not always fixed retroactively in version 4.x) and a number of enhancements and new features have been added.

## Installation of OmegaT 5

If you have OmegaT 4 (probably 4.2.0 to be precise) or other versions installed in your machine, you can install OmegaT 5 in parallel without needing to remove other OmegaT installations, if that's what you want (and probably that's what you want for testing purposes).

You may proceed as follows:

- Click [here](sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/files/OmegaT%20-%20Latest/OmegaT%205.7.1/OmegaT_5.7.1_Beta_Windows_64_Signed.exe/download) to download OmegaT 5.7.1.
<!-- - Click [here](https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/omegat/OmegaT%20-%20Latest/OmegaT%205.5.0/OmegaT_5.5.0_Beta_Windows_64_Signed.exe?ts=gAAAAABhHNZA-vb6DCqpEXZL_spgDLNgDuq7PWADK0eKQVY8sthF4YbPXXOPbdAvpzWS_dFjbi2IXtJ1kBhe-1nw3IC5AvHHuQ%3D%3D&r=https%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fomegat%2Ffiles%2FOmegaT%2520-%2520Latest%2FOmegaT%25205.5.0%2FOmegaT_5.5.0_Beta_Windows_64_Signed.exe%2Fdownload) to download OmegaT 5.5.0.-->
- Double click the executable file you have downloaded to start the installation.
- Follow all steps as usual but in the **Select Destination Location**, where you might see the path of your current installation (e.g. `C:\Program Files\OmegaT`), make sure you enter a different path (e.g. `C:\Program Files\OmegaT_5.7.1`) so that OmegaT does not overwrite your existing installation of OmegaT 4.2.0.
- Once the installation is complete, make a shortcut to file `C:\Program Files\OmegaT_5.5.0\OmegaT.exe` and put it on your desktop or your taskbar, in a way that it doesn't get confused with shortcuts for any other versions.

Your user configuration folder is common for all your OmegaT installations (unless you change it), so all your recent projects and customization should be available in OmegaT 5.x as well. As of today (2021-08-18), the customization version is 69.

## Testing

This is an ad-hoc testing task, you are free to test the functionalities that you normally use and explore as you see fit. 

Some functions will be a bit different and you might find new features, which should be fine, and might simply entail updates in user guides and documentation. 

If it is the case that you are unable to produce the expected outcome by doing one of your current actions does or a slight variation of it, then it would be a good idea that you create a ticket in our **OmegaT Helpdesk**.

Of course, any obvious bugs or errors should also deserve a ticket.
