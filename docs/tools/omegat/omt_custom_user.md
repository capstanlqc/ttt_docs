# OmegaT (4.2.0) customization in a nutshell (for Windows)

The following instructions apply to Windows users, please create a ticket if you use Mac or Linux.

Please proceed as follows:

1. Make sure file extensions are displayed in your computer, you can follow tips [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/).
2. If OmegaT 4.2.0 is already installed in your machine, skip this step. If it's not, please install it. You can download it from [this link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/omegat/files/OmegaT%20-%20Latest/OmegaT%204.2.0/OmegaT_4.2.0_Beta_Windows_64_Signed.exe/download).
3. Download the customization script from [this location](https://cat.capstan.be/OmegaT/installer/scripts/updateConfigBundle.groovy). When download is complete, please make sure your browser didn't add a `.txt` extension or any other to it (some browsers do) -- the file extension of the script should be `.groovy`.
4. In OmegaT, go to **Tools** > **Scripting** > **File** > **Open Script** and open the customization script. You will have to navigate in your system to find it (it probably is in your Downloads folder)
5. When the script is open in the scripting window, press the **Run** button.  The script will run and customize your installation. You might need to restart OmegaT at the end.

> ðŸ‘‰ **WARNING**  
> The script might warn you that some `jar` files are found in path `C:\Program Files\OmegaT\plugins` and cannot be deleted automatically. If that's the case, please delete them manually.
