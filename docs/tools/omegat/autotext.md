<!-- ## Autotext -->

You may insert any special character in OmegaT using autotext.

To see the list of special characters and their shortcuts in OmegaT, go to **Options** > **Preferences** > **Auto-completion** > **Autotext** (or check them out online [here](https://github.com/capstanlqc/omegat-customization/blob/master/docs/omegat-autotext.md)).

If there is a special character that you would like to have added to the list (for all users), please create a ticket in the OmegaT helpdesk to let us know.

!!! info
    See a specific example: how to insert [no-break spaces](nbsp.md).

### Autotext shortcut

In OmegaT we include the custom autotext shortcut `\shy` to insert a soft hyphen. A soft hyphen character will be inserted in the position in the text where `\shy` was typed. 

### Word joiners

It's also possible to use a special character in a specific position to produce the opposite result (adjacent characters should be joined together as a single word, without the possibility of a line break between them) but we haven't added any autotext shortcut for that in OmegaT yet. We will if needed.
