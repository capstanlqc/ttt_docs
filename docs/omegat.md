## Autotext

You may insert any special character using autotext.

To see the list of special characters and their shortcuts in OmegaT, go to **Options** > **Preferences** > **Auto-completion** > **Autotext** (or check them out online [here](https://github.com/capstanlqc/omegat-customization/blob/master/docs/omegat-autotext.md)).

If there is a special character that would like to have added to the list (for all users), please create a ticket in the OmegaT helpdesk to let us know.
