## Feminine gender abbreviation

According to the Polish local agency, gender inflection in the translation of pronoun 'you' (in all declensions) and second-person verbs must be done using the male form with any additional suffix (one or more lettrs) in brackets for the feminine form. In case of substitution the dash must be used before the new letter(s).

Examples:

1. Creating female form by adding letters: “You (polite, in terms of Mr./Mrs.) did” = “Pan zrobił” for male and “Pani zrobiła” for female = “Pan(i) zrobił(a)” compressed.

2. Creating female form by substituting letters: “You (polite, in terms of Mr./Mrs.) are willing” = “Pan jest skłonny” for male and “Pani jest skłonna” for female = “Pan(i) jest skłonny(-a) compressed. 

In the case of the genitive (your) “Pana/Pani”, it should be written “Pana(-i)”, meaning that we substitute "a" by "i". 

DO:

- Nie jest Pan(i) pewien/pewna... 

DON'T:

- jakie wydatki obejmuje Pana/Pani ubezpieczenie
