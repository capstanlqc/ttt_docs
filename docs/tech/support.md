## TeamViewer -- QuickSupport

When the support agent sends the QuickSupport utility link to the user, the user must simply click on it to download the utility, then double click the utility to run it, then authorize the support agent's access.

If the user is an employee or member of the team, they might already have TeamViewer installed by Harras. In that case, they will not be able to run the QuickSupport utility. They might not be able to provide a password together with their ID.

What to do:

* Instruct the user to close TeamViewer in their machine before running the QuickSupport utility.
* To close TeamViewer, they must right click on the icon in the system tray, then select Exit.
* After that, double click the QuickSupport utility and authorize access.
